	abstract = {Within the class of ARMAX models we consider the effects systematic sampling or temporal aggregation may have on the dynamic relationships between variables. These include changes in lag lengths and causal ordering and may occur even in simple models. Some implications for the modelling of time series are noted. For the subclass of ARIMA models we also analyse the consequences of sampling or aggregating seasonal models.},
